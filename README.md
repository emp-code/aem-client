[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/emp-code/aem-client/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/emp-code/aem-client) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/emp-code/aem-client/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/emp-code/aem-client/?branch=master)

## Web ##

The JavaScript library, *all-ears.js*, is made for web clients.

The `<meta>` tag aem.provider specifies the domain of the All-Ears Mail API. If left blank, the library assumes the API operates at the current domain.

--

*Modern* and *Original* are web clients using the library, with the former being in more active development. As single-page web apps, each has three files: main.js, main.css, and index.html.

*Local.sh* can be used to create a single-file standalone web app that can be run locally.

## APIs ##

All APIs require an account, and use a custom binary format. Only a timestamp in the request is in plaintext. Everything else about requests is encrypted, and responses are entirely encrypted.
